This TODO list is automatically generated from the cookiecutter-python-project template.
The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:

* Push to your remote repository for the first time by doing `git push origin main`.
* Add the secret variable `PYPI_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub project. This can be done in your
  use settings at `https://pypi.org`. Note that currently, you have to create an unscoped token
  for your first upload and only after that you can create a new token whose scope is restricted
  to the current project.
